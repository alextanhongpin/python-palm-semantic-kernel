      "Semantic Kernel is a lightweight SDK that lets you mix conventional programming languages, like C# and Python, with the latest in LLM (Large Language Model) technology. It provides a way to interact with LLMs through semantic functions, which are functions that expect a natural language input and return a result. Semantic Kernel also provides tooling that makes it easier to build and use LLMs in your applications.\n",
